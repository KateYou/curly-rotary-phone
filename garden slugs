The following eight methods can help you cut down on the number of destructive snails and slugs in your balcony container garden. To learn more about snails and slugs, read “Pests: Garden Snails and Slugs.”

1. Gritty substances. The first method for garden snail and slug control is to use a gritty substance. Snails do not travel over gritty substances, such as crushed eggshells or sharp sand, that have been spread around your container plants. Put a layer of grit in your plant containers, and snails will avoid these plants. If they do crawl there, the grit will clog their slime glands and it will kill them. Spread sharp and angular gravel (not smooth rocks) over soil so the snails can’t climb. All of these gritty substances will irritate the snail and slug’s delicate undersides.
 
2. Beer traps. The second method for garden snail and slug control is to make a beer trap. First fill a shallow pan with stale beer and leave it out overnight. The snails will be attracted to the beer and climb into the pan. Make sure the pan filled with beer is deep enough so the snails will drown in it and not be able to climb out. Slugs will especially need a deeper container, such as a yogurt container. Replace the beer in the pan every couple of days. These trap must be buried so the top of the pan is at ground level, so balcony container gardeners (who cannot bury them in the ground) should provide easy access for the slugs and snails by creating some sort of ramp.

3. Other traps. Other traps will attract snails to a certain spot in the container garden where you can find them later and kill them. Put a pie pan upside-down on the ground (with a hole cut in the side so snails can climb in), and put some citrus peels or other snail food inside. The snails will climb underneath the pan for the food and for the cool, dark protection from the morning sun. Check every morning, and replace the food often.
