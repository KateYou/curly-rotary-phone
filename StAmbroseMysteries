In his eucharistic 
teaching he follows Ambrose in his assertion of the 
operative power of the word of Christ in changing the 
elements into the body and blood of Christ. But he 
goes further than Ambrose in his recoil from the material- 
istic conclusions that might be drawn from this doctrine, 
and in so doing he falls back on the earlier language 
which speaks of receiving "the likeness of the death" 
and "drinking the likeness of the blood," . and comes 
very near to conceiving of the presence of Christ in 
the Eucharist as a presence of grace and power only 
(iv. 4. 20 ; vi. 1. 3. See further, p. xxxvii below). In 
the passage iii. 2. 13 f. he may possibly have in view the 
Pelagian denial of original sin, in which case we have 
an indication that the author is later than Ambrose. 
If, further, the reference to the Greek custom of com- 
municating once a year (v. 4. 25) is due to acquaintance 
with Chrysostom's homilies (see note, f.c.) t we have a 
further indication of late date. Lastly, it is improbable 
that Ambrose would have so closely copied an earlier 
work of his own. 

Like de Myst., this treatise came prominently into 
notice in connexion with the controversies between 
Catholics and Protestants at the time of the Reformation. 
Its authenticity was attacked by Bullinger, by Aubertin 
(whose verdict was " He is the ape of Ambrose "), and 
by Daille. Aubertin assigned it to the seventh century, 
Daille to the eighth. Doubts were also expressed on 
the opposite side by Cardinal Bona and the Benedictine 
editors. Various theories have been propounded as to 
the authorship. Tillemont's suggestion of Maximus of 
Turin has gained little credence. It has been revived 
in recent times by Schermann {Rom. Quartalschrift, xvii. 
(1903), 254 f.), who points out that in the oldest MS. of 
de Sacram. the book follows immediately the Homilies
